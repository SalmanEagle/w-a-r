# w-a-r

w-a-r (Women Advancing Resource): Paying individuals for any job applications via an Ethereum token, based on Upvotes received at Reddit community.

- PHASE 1:

* Set up community on Reddit for Job Applicants to submit evidence (e.g. screenshots) of job applications by them. Note, however, that a community member can submit any picture - our program will not check what exactly is submitted.

- PHASE 2:

* Write a smart contract that enables Job Applicants to be paid for their job applications.

- PHASE 3:

* Use Reddit API to integrate the Upvotes in our communty (https://www.reddit.com/r/FlowerEconomics/) with the smart contract.

- Even Zero Upvotes = 0.01 w-a-r token.
- One Upvote = 0.1 w-a-r token.
- Members with 50 Reddit KARMA are automatically made Moderators.

* Suppose a person posts a screenshot as evidence of their having applied for a job, and that post on Reddit gets 1 Upvote; the job applicant will get 0.1 token of our ETH smart contract.
* Investors will buy these tokens, and each token will be costed as [total amount invested / total number of tokens issued].

- PHASE 4:

* Members of FE Reddit community with at least [50 Reddit Karma AND Female Avatars] are considered MODERATORS and compensated at 3 Ethereum (ETH) TOKENS of w-a-r per month.

* COLLABORATION NOTES:

- First use Remix IDE for testing functions on Ethereum network.
- Then copy your code to vscode as a .sol file.

* RESEARCH:
