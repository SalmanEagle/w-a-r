# w-a-r

w-a-r (Women Advancing Resource): paying people, qualified by their Reddit karma, for job applications via an (decentralized) Ethereum token (smart contract).

- Phase 1:

* Set up community on Reddit for job applicants to submit evidence (e.g. screenshots) of job applications by them.

- Phase 2:

* Write a smart contract that enables job applicants to be paid for their job applications.

- Phase 3:

* Use Reddit API to integrate https://www.reddit.com/r/FlowerEconomics/ with the smart contract.

- Suppose a person posts a screenshot as evidence of their having applied for a job, and that post on Reddit gets 1 Upvote; the job applicant will get 1 token of our ETH smart contract.
- Investors will buy these tokens, and each token will cost [amount invested / total number of tokens issued].

* Phase 4:

- Enable women to buy the (Ethereum) smart contract tokens for 1/3rd the regular price. Identification to be done via voice.
