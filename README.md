# w-a-r

w-a-r (Women Advancing Resource): paying individuals, qualified by their Reddit karma, for job applications via an Ethereum token.

- PHASE 1:

* Set up community on Reddit for job applicants to submit evidence (e.g. screenshots) of job applications by them.

- PHASE 2:

* Write a smart contract that enables job applicants to be paid for their job applications.

- PHASE 3:

* Use Reddit API to integrate the Karma/Upvotes in our communty (https://www.reddit.com/r/FlowerEconomics/) with the smart contract.

- Even Zero Karma = 0.5 w-a-r token.
- Even Zero Upvotes = 0.5 w-a-r token.

* Suppose a person posts a screenshot as evidence of their having applied for a job, and that post on Reddit gets 1 Upvote; the job applicant will get 1 token of our ETH smart contract.
* Investors will buy these tokens, and each token will be costed as [total amount invested / total number of tokens issued].

- PHASE 4:

* Enable women to buy the (Ethereum) smart contract tokens for 1/3rd the regular price. Identification to be done via voice.

* COLLABORATION NOTES:

- First use Remix IDE for testing functions on Ethereum network.
- Then copy your code to vscode as a .sol file.

* RESEARCH:
