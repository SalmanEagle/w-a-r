# w-a-r

w-a-r (Women Advancing Resource): Paying individuals for any (gig economy or otherwise) job applications via an Ethereum token, based on Upvotes received at Reddit community.

- PHASE 1:

* Set up community on Reddit for Job Applicants to submit evidence (e.g. screenshots) of job applications by them. Note, however, that a community member can submit any picture - our program will not check what exactly is submitted. Moderators' task is only to ensure that the proof that is submitted, is indeed a Job Application.
* Posts by Gig Economy Workers, e.g. YouTube Videos or Open-Source Code contributed, qualify as "Job Applications" too.

- PHASE 2:

* Write a smart contract in Solidity that enables Job Applicants to be paid for their job applications.

- PHASE 3:

* Use Reddit API to integrate the Upvotes in our communty (https://www.reddit.com/r/FlowerEconomics/) with the smart contract.
* Even Zero OR Negative Upvotes = 0.01 w-a-r ETH token.
* One Upvote = 0.1 w-a-r ETH token.
* Investors are enabled to buy these Tokens, and each token will be costed as [total amount invested / total number of tokens issued].

- PHASE 4:

* [Members of FE Reddit community, verified as Women] OR [Members of FE Reddit community with at least 50 Reddit Karma AND Female Avatars] are considered MODERATORS and compensated at 3 Ethereum (ETH) TOKENS of w-a-r per month.

- COLLABORATION NOTES:

* First use Remix IDE for testing functions on Ethereum network.
* Then copy your code to vscode as a .sol file.
